						one of the world's largest video game companies by market capitalization, creating some of the best-known and top-selling
						video game franchises, such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, and Pok√©mon. Founded on 23 September 1889 by Fusajiro Yamauchi,

						into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's
						third most-valuable company with a market value of over $85 billion. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo">Source wikipedia</a>
