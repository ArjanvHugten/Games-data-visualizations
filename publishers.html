						1889 by Fusajiro Yamauchi,

						small niche businesses,
						such as cab services and love hotels. Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the
						1960s, Nintendo developed
						into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the
						industry and Japan's
						third most-valuable company with a market value of over $85 billion. <a

						into Sony Interactive
						Entertainment, carrying over the operations and primary objectives from both companies. The same
						year, SIE moved its
						headquarters from Tokyo to San Mateo, California. Sony Interactive Entertainment handles the
						research and development,
						production, and sales of both hardware and software for the PlayStation video game systems. SIE
						is also a developer
						and publisher of video game titles, and operates several subsidiaries in Sony's largest markets:

						and Asia. By August 2018, the company had sold more than 525 million PlayStation consoles
						worldwide. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony">Source wikipedia</a> </p>
