          <h5>Action</h5>
          <p>The action game is a video game genre that emphasizes physical challenges, including handâ€“eye coordination
            and
            reaction-time. The genre includes a large variety of sub-genres, such as fighting games, beat 'em ups,
            shooter
            games and platform games which are widely considered the most important action games, though multiplayer
            online battle arena and some real-time strategy games are also considered to be action games. In an action
            game,
            the player typically controls a character often in the form of a protagonist or avatar. This player
            character
            must navigate a level, collecting objects, avoiding obstacles, and battling enemies with their natural
            skills
            as well as weapons and other tools at their disposal. At the end of a level or group of levels, the player
            must
            often defeat a boss enemy that is more challenging and often a major antagonist in the game's story. Enemy
            attacks
            and obstacles deplete the player character's health and lives, and the player receives a Game over when they
            run out of lives. Alternatively, the player gets to the end of the game by finishing a sequence of levels
            and
            seeing the credits. But some action games, such as early arcade games, are unbeatable and have an indefinite
            number of levels; with the player's only goal being to get as far as they can to maximize their score.

          <h5>Sports</h5>
          <p>A sports game is a video game genre that simulates the practice of sports. Most sports have been recreated
            with
            a game, including team sports, track and field, extreme sports and combat sports. Some games emphasize
            actually
            playing the sport (such as the Madden NFL series), whilst others emphasize strategy and sport management
            (such
            as Championship Manager and Out of the Park Baseball). Some, such as Need for Speed, Arch Rivals and
            Punch-Out!!,
            satirize the sport for comic effect. This genre has been popular throughout the history of video games and
            is
            competitive, just like real-world sports. A number of game series feature the names and characteristics of
            real
            teams and players, and are updated annually to reflect real-world changes. Sports genre is one of the oldest
            genres in gaming history. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_game">Source wikipedia</a></p>

          <h5>Shooter</h5>
          <p>Shooter games are a subgenre of action game, which often test the player's speed and reaction time. It
            includes
            many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar using some sort of
            weapons.
            Usually this weapon is a gun or some other long-range weapon. A common resource found in many shooter games
            is
            ammunition. Most commonly, the purpose of a shooter game is to shoot opponents and proceed through missions
            without
            the player character being killed or dying. A shooting game is a genre of video game where the player has
            limited
            spatial control of his or her character, and the focus is almost entirely on the defeat of the character's
            enemies
            using long-range weaponry. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooter_game">Source wikipedia</a></p>

          <h5>Role-Playing</h5>
          <p>A role-playing game (sometimes spelled roleplaying game and abbreviated to RPG) is a game in which players
            assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these
            roles
            within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making of
            character
            development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and
            guidelines.
            There are several forms of RPG. The original form, sometimes called the tabletop role-playing game (TRPG),
            is
            conducted through discussion, whereas in live action role-playing games (LARP) players physically perform
            their
            characters' actions. In both of these forms, an arranger called a game master (GM) usually decides on the
            rules and setting to be used, acting as referee, while each of the other players plays the role of a single
            character.
            Several varieties of RPG also exist in electronic media, such as multi-player text-based MUDs and their
            graphics-based
            successors, massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). Role-playing games also include
            single-player
            role-playing video games in which players control a character or team who undertake quests, and may include
            capabilities
            that advance using statistical mechanics. These games often share settings and rules with tabletop RPGs, but
            emphasize character advancement more than collaborative storytelling. Despite this variety of forms, some
            game forms such as trading card games and wargames that are related to role-playing games may not be
            included.
            Role-playing activity may sometimes be present in such games, but it is not the primary focus. The term is
            also sometimes used to describe roleplay simulation games and exercises used in teaching, training, and
            academic
            research. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game">Source wikipedia</a></p>

          <h5>Platform</h5>
          <p>Platform games, or platformers, are a video game genre and subgenre of action game. In a platformer the
            player
            controlled character must jump and climb between suspended platforms while avoiding obstacles. Environments
            often
            feature uneven terrain of varying height that must be traversed. The player often has some control over the
            height
            and distance of jumps to avoid letting their character fall to their death or miss necessary jumps. The most
            common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternatives like
            swiping a touchscreen. Other acrobatic maneuvers may factor into the gameplay as well, such as swinging from
            objects such as vines or grappling hooks, as in Ristar or Bionic Commando, or bouncing from springboards or
            trampolines,
            as in Alpha Waves. These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called platforming, a
            verbification
            of platform. Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in The Legend of Zelda series,
            fall
            outside of the genre. Platform games originated in the early 1980s, which were often about climbing ladders
            as
            much as jumping, with 3D successors popularized in the mid-1990s. The term describes games where jumping on
            platforms
            is an integral part of the gameplay and came into use after the genre had been established, no later than
            1983.
            The genre is frequently combined with elements of other genres, such as the shooter elements in Contra, Beat
            'em up elements of Viewtiful Joe, adventure elements of Flashback, or role-playing game elements of
            Castlevania:
            Symphony of the Night. While commonly associated with console gaming, there have been many important
            platform
            games released to video arcades, as well as for handheld game consoles and home computers. North America,
            Europe
            and Japan have played major parts in the genre's evolution. Platform themes range from cartoon-like games to
            science fiction and fantasy epics. At one point, platform games were the most popular genre of video game.
            At
            the peak of their popularity, it is estimated that between one-quarter and one-third of console games were
            platformers.
            No genre either before or since has been able to achieve a similar market share. As of 2006, the genre had
            become
            far less dominant, representing a two percentage market share as compared to fifteen percent in 1998, but
            is still commercially viable, with a number of games selling in the millions of units. Since 2010, a variety
            of endless running platformers for mobile devices have brought renewed popularity to the genre. <a
