          <h5>Playstation 2</h5>
          <p>The PlayStation 2 (PS2) is a home video game console that was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It
            is the
            successor to the original PlayStation console and is the second installment in the PlayStation lineup of
            consoles.
            It was released in 2000 and competed with Sega's Dreamcast, Nintendo's GameCube and Microsoft's Xbox in the
            sixth
            generation of video game consoles. Announced in 1999, the PlayStation 2 offered backwards compatibility for
            its
            predecessor's DualShock controller, as well as for its games. The PlayStation 2 is the best-selling video
            game
            console of all time, selling over 155 million units, with 150 million confirmed by Sony in 2011. More than
            3,874
            game titles have been released for the PS2 since launch, and more than 1.5 billion copies have been sold.
            Sony
            later manufactured several smaller, lighter revisions of the console known as Slimline models in 2004. In
            2006,
            Sony announced and launched its successor, the PlayStation 3. Even with the release of its successor, the
            PlayStation
            2 remained popular well into the seventh generation and continued to be produced until January 4, 2013, when
            Sony finally announced that the PlayStation 2 had been discontinued after 12 years of production – one of
            the
            longest runs for a video game console. Despite the announcement, new games for the console continued to be
            produced
            until the end of 2013, including Final Fantasy XI: Seekers of Adoulin for Japan, FIFA 13 for North America,
            and
            Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 for Europe. Repair services for the system in Japan ended on September 7, 2018.

          <h5>XBOX 360</h5>
          <p>The Xbox 360 is a home video game console developed by Microsoft. As the successor to the original Xbox, it
            is
            the second console in the Xbox series. It competed with Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Wii as part of
            the
            seventh generation of video game consoles. It was officially unveiled on MTV on May 12, 2005, with detailed
            launch
            and game information announced later that month at the 2005 E3 expo. The Xbox 360 features an online
            service,
            Xbox Live, which was expanded from its previous iteration on the original Xbox and received regular updates
            during
            the console's lifetime. Available in free and subscription-based varieties, Xbox Live allows users to: play
            games
            online; download games (through Xbox Live Arcade) and game demos; purchase and stream music, television
            programs,
            and films through the Xbox Music and Xbox Video portals; and access third-party content services through
            media
            streaming applications. In addition to online multimedia features, it allows users to stream media from
            local
            PCs. Several peripherals have been released, including wireless controllers, expanded hard drive storage,
            and
            the Kinect motion sensing camera. The release of these additional services and peripherals helped the Xbox
            brand
            grow from gaming-only to encompassing all multimedia, turning it into a hub for living-room computing
            entertainment.
            Launched worldwide across 2005–2006, the Xbox 360 was initially in short supply in many regions, including
            North
            America and Europe. The earliest versions of the console suffered from a high failure rate, indicated by the
            so-called "Red Ring of Death", necessitating an extension of the device's warranty period. Microsoft
            released
            two redesigned models of the console: the Xbox 360 S in 2010, and the Xbox 360 E in 2013. As of June 2014,
            84
            million Xbox 360 consoles have been sold worldwide, making it the sixth-highest-selling video game console
            in
            history, and the highest-selling console made by an American company. Although not the best-selling console
            of
            its generation, the Xbox 360 was deemed by TechRadar to be the most influential through its emphasis on
            digital
            media distribution and multiplayer gaming on Xbox Live. The Xbox 360's successor, the Xbox One, was released
            on November 22, 2013. On April 20, 2016, Microsoft announced that it would end the production of new Xbox
            360
            hardware, although the company will continue to support the platform. <a

          <h5>Playstation 3</h5>
          <p>The PlayStation 3 (PS3) is a home video game console developed by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is the
            successor
            to PlayStation 2, and is part of the PlayStation brand of consoles. It was first released on November 11,
            2006,
            in Japan, November 17, 2006, in North America, and March 23, 2007, in Europe and Australia. The PlayStation
            3
            competed mainly against consoles such as Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh
            generation
            of video game consoles. The console was first officially announced at E3 2005, and was released at the end
            of
            2006. It was the first console to use Blu-ray Disc as its primary storage medium. The console was the first
            PlayStation
            to integrate social gaming services, including being the first to introduce Sony's social gaming service,
            PlayStation
            Network, and its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita, being able to remote
            control
            the console from the devices. In September 2009, the Slim model of the PlayStation 3 was released. It no
            longer
            provided the hardware ability to run PS2 games. It was lighter and thinner than the original version, and
            featured
            a redesigned logo and marketing design, as well as a minor start-up change in software. A Super Slim
            variation
            was then released in late 2012, further refining and redesigning the console. During its early years, the
            system
            had a critically negative reception, due to its high price ($599 for a 60 gigabyte model, and $499 for a 20
            GB
            model), a complex processor architecture and a lack of quality games, but was praised for its Blu-ray
            capabilities
            and "untapped potential". The reception would get more positive over time. The system had a slow start in
            the
            market but managed to recover, particularly after the introduction of the Slim model. Its successor, the
            PlayStation
            4, was released later in November 2013. On September 29, 2015, Sony confirmed that sales of the PlayStation
            3
            were to be discontinued in New Zealand, but the system remained in production in other markets. Shipments of
            new units to Europe and Australia ended in March 2016, followed by North America which ended in October
            2016.
            Heading into 2017, Japan was the last territory where new units were still being produced until May 29,
            2017,
            when Sony confirmed the PlayStation 3 was discontinued in Japan. <a

          <h5>Wii</h5>
          <p>
            The Wii is a home video game console released by Nintendo on November 19, 2006. As a seventh-generation
            console, the Wii
            competed with Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Sony's PlayStation 3. Nintendo states that its console targets a
            broader
            demographic than that of the two others. As of the first quarter of 2016, the Wii led its generation over
            the
            PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in worldwide sales, with more than 101 million units sold; in December 2009, the
            console
            broke the sales record for a single month in the United States. The Wii introduced the Wii Remote
            controller,
            which can be used as a handheld pointing device and which detects movement in three dimensions. Another
            feature
            of the console is the now defunct WiiConnect24, which enabled Wii to receive messages and updates over the
            Internet
            while in standby mode. Like other seventh-generation consoles, it features a game download service, called
            "Virtual
            Console", which features emulated games from past Nintendo consoles. It succeeded the GameCube, and early
            models
            are fully backward-compatible with all GameCube games and most accessories. Nintendo first spoke of the
            console
            at the E3 2004 press conference and later unveiled it at E3 2005. Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata revealed a
            prototype
            of the controller at the September 2005 Tokyo Game Show. At E3 2006, the console won the first of several
            awards.
            By December 8, 2006, it had completed its launch in the four key markets. In late 2011, Nintendo released a
            reconfigured
            model, the "Wii Family Edition", which lacks Nintendo GameCube compatibility; this model was not released in
            Japan. The Wii Mini, Nintendo's first major console redesign since the compact SNES, succeeded the standard
            Wii
            model and was released first in Canada on December 7, 2012. The Wii Mini can only play Wii optical discs, as
            it omits GameCube compatibility and all networking capabilities; this model was not released in Japan,
            Australia,
            or New Zealand. The Wii's successor, the Wii U, was released on November 18, 2012. On October 20, 2013,
            Nintendo
            confirmed it had discontinued production of the Wii in Japan and Europe. <a

          <h5>Nintendo DS</h5>
          <p>The Nintendo DS, or simply DS, is a dual-screen handheld game console developed and released by Nintendo.
            The device
            went on sale in North America on November 21, 2004. The DS, short for "Developers' System" or "Dual Screen",
            introduced distinctive new features to handheld gaming: two LCD screens working in tandem (the bottom one
            featuring
            a touchscreen), a built-in microphone, and support for wireless connectivity. Both screens are encompassed
            within
            a clamshell design similar to the Game Boy Advance SP. The Nintendo DS also features the ability for
            multiple
            DS consoles to directly interact with each other over Wi-Fi within a short range without the need to connect
            to an existing wireless network. Alternatively, they could interact online using the now-defunct Nintendo
            Wi-Fi
            Connection service. Its main competitor was Sony's PlayStation Portable as part of the seventh generation
            era.
            It was likened to the Nintendo 64 from the 1990s, which led to several N64 ports such as Super Mario 64 DS
            and
            Diddy Kong Racing DS, among others. Prior to its release, the Nintendo DS was marketed as an experimental,
            "third
            pillar" in Nintendo's console lineup, meant to complement the Game Boy Advance and GameCube. However,
            backward
            compatibility with Game Boy Advance titles and strong sales ultimately established it as the successor to
            the
            Game Boy series. On March 2, 2006, Nintendo launched the Nintendo DS Lite, a slimmer and lighter redesign of
            the original Nintendo DS with brighter screens. On November 1, 2008, Nintendo released the Nintendo DSi,
            another
            redesign with several hardware improvements and new features. All Nintendo DS models combined have sold
            154.02
            million units, making it the best selling handheld game console to date, and the second best selling video
            game
            console of all time behind Sony's PlayStation 2. The Nintendo DS line was succeeded by the Nintendo 3DS
            family
            in 2011, which maintains backward compatibility with nearly all Nintendo DS software. <a
